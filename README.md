# Fetal health classification

This project focuses on the classification of fetal health using traditional machine learning models, rather than deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the health status of a fetus based on various medical parameters and features.

## Key Features
1. **Diverse Model Selection:** The project explores and implements a variety of non-deep learning machine learning models, including decision trees, `random forests`, `support vector machines`, `Gradient boosting`, `XGboost`, `CatBoost`, `logistic regression` etc.. This diverse selection enables a comprehensive evaluation of different approaches for fetal health classification.

2. **Interpretable Predictions:** The selected machine learning algorithms provide interpretable predictions. This feature is essential for medical applications, allowing healthcare professionals to understand the factors contributing to fetal health predictions and make informed decisions.

3. **Performance Evaluation:** The project rigorously evaluates model performance using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This ensures that the chosen machine learning models are effective in classifying fetal health, providing reliable results for clinical decision-making.
